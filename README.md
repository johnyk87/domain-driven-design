# Domain Driven Design

## Concepts

### Entities

- Entities have **identity**.
- Identity is defined by representing the **same "thing"**, regardless of whether other attributes have changed.
- The model must specify what it **means** to be the same thing (aka, how to compare entity identities).
- Entities should be used only where identity needs to be tracked.
